E-Commerce Synthetic Data Project – Online Bookstore

This project demonstrates a complete workflow for generating synthetic e-commerce data, ingesting it into a SQLite database, and performing analytical SQL queries.
The setup is designed to be executed inside Cursor IDE using prompt-driven development.

Step 1 — Generate Synthetic CSV Files (Cursor Prompt)

Create a new folder and open it in Cursor.
Run this prompt to generate five synthetic CSV files:

Prompt 1
I need to generate synthetic e-commerce data for an Online Bookstore. Please provide 5 separate CSV files with about 20 rows of data in each:
members.csv (columns: member_id, full_name, email, membership_level)
authors.csv (columns: author_id, author_name, country)
books.csv (columns: book_id, title, author_id, genre, price)
orders.csv (columns: order_id, member_id, order_date, status)
order_details.csv (columns: detail_id, order_id, book_id, quantity)

Cursor will generate the 5 CSV files automatically.

Step 2 — Ingest Data into SQLite (ingest.py)

Create a Python script named ingest.py using this prompt:

Prompt 2
Write a Python script named ingest.py to load this e-commerce data into a database.

Please use the context from my files: @members.csv, @authors.csv,
@books.csv, @orders.csv, and @order_details.csv.

The script must:

- Import sqlite3 and csv.
- Connect to a new database named bookstore.db.
- Loop through the list of my 5 filenames.
- For each file:
    • Read the header row to get accurate column names.
    • Dynamically create a table matching the filename (e.g., table 'books' for 'books.csv').
    • Filter out any empty rows (handle blank lines safely).
    • Insert the valid data into the table.
- Print a success message like 'Successfully ingested books.csv'.
- Ensure the script handles the data sequentially without crashing.

Run the ingestion script
python3 ingest.py

This will generate a bookstore.db database with all 5 tables populated.

Step 3 — Query the Data (query.py)

Create the analytics script query.py using this prompt:

Prompt 3
Create a Python script named query.py.

The script should:

- Connect to bookstore.db.
- Execute an SQL query that joins members, orders, order_details,
  books, and authors.
- The query should calculate the total revenue generated by each Author.
- Select columns: Author Name, Book Title, and Total Sales Amount
  (price * quantity).
- Order results by Total Sales Amount from highest to lowest.
- Print the results in a clean, formatted table in the terminal.
- Add a menu at the start so the user can choose to run this query or exit.

Run the query script
python3 query.py

Then choose option 1 to run the revenue analysis.

Summary

This project covers:

✔ Generating synthetic e-commerce data (CSV files)
✔ Loading data into a structured SQLite database
✔ Executing multi-table joins to analyze bookstore revenue
✔ Building Python scripts for ingestion and querying

Perfect for practicing Cursor AI workflow, SQLite, CSV processing, and Python automation.
